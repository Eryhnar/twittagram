## About the project
This was the fifth project for an FSD bootcamp at GeeksHubs Academy. The project consisted in making a backend app with both the api and the database for a social media using mongo, mongoose and js.    

## Goal
The project required us to make a database in mongodb and a minimum of two collections, users and posts. 

This had to be connected to the api and the api was required to include at least the following endpoints: 

- POST /api/auth/register 
- POST /api/auth/login

- GET /api/users
- GET /api/users/profile
- PUT /api/users/profile

- POST /api/posts
- PUT /api/posts
- GET /api/posts/{id}
- GET /api/posts
- GET /api/posts/own
- GET /api/users/posts/{user-id}
- DELETE /api/posts/{id}

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: ` $ git clone https://github.com/Eryhnar/twittagram/tree/master`
2. ` $ npm install `
3. Create a mondodb database. I recommend using docker for this step.
4. Set the .env file and adjust the params for the database.
5. Connect to the database. If the .env is set properly, executing the following command within the ide console will connect to the database ``` $ npm run dev ```
6. Import the routes from the thunder routes collection folder.

## Credentials
    These are some of the credentials provided in the seeder.
    - user@user.com password: Aa123456 user
    - admin@admin.com password: Aa123456 admin
    - super_admin@super_admin.com password: Aa123456 super_admin

## Decisions

- I decided to take an approach where I avoid denormalizing the database as I think it is unnecessary but I have indexed the fields that are used in queries to speed up fetches considering the drawback in an api like this are acceptable.

## Roadmap
- Implement aggregate fetches for complex fetches.
- Review code to unify some parts where functions still keep the old approach.
- Abstract auth into service and repository.
- Clean up code.
- Add testing.
- Complete seeders so that they include saved in users and replies in comments.
