## About the project
This was the fifth project for an FSD bootcamp at GeeksHubs Academy. The project consisted in making a backend app with both the api and the database for a social media using mongo, mongoose and js.    

## Goal
The project required us to make a database in mongodb and a minimum of two collections, users and posts. 

This had to be connected to the api and the api was required to include at least the following endpoints: 

- POST /api/auth/register 
- POST /api/auth/login

- GET /api/users
- GET /api/users/profile
- PUT /api/users/profile

- POST /api/posts
- PUT /api/posts
- GET /api/posts/{id}
- GET /api/posts
- GET /api/posts/own
- GET /api/users/posts/{user-id}
- DELETE /api/posts/{id}

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: ` $ git clone https://github.com/Eryhnar/twittagram/tree/master`
2. ` $ npm install `
3. Create a mondodb database. I recommend using docker for this step.
3. Set the .env file and adjust the params for the database.
4. Connect to the database. If the .env is set properly the following command will connect to the database ``` $ npm run dev ```
5. ``` $ npm run migrations-run ``` 
6. ``` $ npm run dev ``` Start the server.
7. ``` $  ``` Run the seeders.
8. ``` $ npm run migrations-revert ``` If you ever need to revert them.
9. Import the routes from the thunder routes collection folder.

- move middlewares and helpers onto their own files.
- add an option for random artist on appointment creation and update.
- add an updated_by field to all tables.
- add pagination.
